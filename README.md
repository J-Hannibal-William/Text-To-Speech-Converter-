# Text-To-Speech-Converter-
This project is a Text-to-Speech (TTS) converter using Python's pyttsx3 library. It allows users to input text and choose between male or female voices, adjust the speech rate, and control the volume. The program then converts the text into speech, offering a simple, interactive interface for customization.
